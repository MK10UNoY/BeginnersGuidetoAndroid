When I created a simple counter app as a part of learning Viewmodel when I tried to implement the viewModel class after following a tutorial
I had come to a realization that my project for some reason was not able to automatically import the required dependency in Android Studio.\

Even after manually typing the "import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel.compose.viewModel"

the androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel did not indeed contain the compose section entirely. The Root cause was found to be outdated files and missing implementation
in the buildgradle.kts file where I added the line " implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.8.1") "  After a gradle sync to implement
the new dependency. The IDLE finally recognized the " compose.viewModel " part of the "androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel" dependency.

Now, that the viewmodel is implemented the final Counter app can mantain it's data even when the app changes orientation without reseting.
